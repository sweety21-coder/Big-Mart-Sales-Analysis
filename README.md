# Big-Mart-Sales-Analysis

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The data scientists at Big Mart have collected Sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2013.Now each product has certain attributes that sets it apart from other products. Same in the case with each store.

### Aim-
The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision makers at Big Mart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.

#### Data Cleaning-
1.Missing value Treatment- Found missing value in 2 columns, we have 17% & 28% missing values in item weight & outlet size column respectively.
Treated with mean & mode respectively.

2.Outlier- No outlier found in the data.

3.Correlation Matrix-

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
Involve univariate & Bivariate analysis, drawn some conclusions from it regarding the data.

#### Label Encoding - Encoding categorical features to get good accuracy.

#### Model Building- 

#### Performance Metrics with diferent models

## Model	RMSE
### 0	Linear Regression	1246.171773
### 1	Ridge Regression	1246.061549
### 2	Lasso Regression	1245.732959
### 3	Decision tree regression	1585.013561

#### Note:- Lasso performs slightly better than other regression model,so we can select Lasso for our final prediction
